Hello! This is Matheus Duarte Ferreira's challenge made for Trustly.

To get the docker image up, use 'docker-compose up --build'

When you first build the docker image it will fun the test before the server is up.

To use this API, you just need to pass a repository to a get query, there are examples if you open the main page (url.domain/)

I really hope this is up for your standards.

Thank you Trustly for the challenge, I actually had fun!
